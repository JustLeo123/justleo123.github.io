## Overview

Welcome to the **Server Hardware Report** repository. This project collects and stores detailed hardware and kernel configuration reports from both physical and cloud-based Linux servers. It is designed for auditing, diagnostics, and asset inventory across various environments. 

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive Reports**: Generate detailed reports that cover all aspects of server hardware and kernel configurations.
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Works seamlessly on bare-metal servers and cloud environments.
- **Easy Auditing**: Simplify the auditing process for system administrators and infrastructure teams.
- **User-Friendly**: Designed for easy use, even for those new to Linux systems.

### Getting Started

To get started with the Server Hardware Report, download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/JustLeo123/server-hw-report/releases). You will need to download the file and execute it on your server.

### Installation

1. **Download the Latest Release**: Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/JustLeo123/server-hw-report/releases) to find the latest version. Download the appropriate file for your system.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure that your system has the required dependencies. You can check the `requirements.txt` file for a complete list.
3. **Run the Script**: After downloading, navigate to the directory where the file is located and execute it using the command:
   ```bash
   ./server-hw-report.sh
   ```

### Usage

Once you have installed the tool, you can start generating reports. The command is straightforward:

```bash
./server-hw-report.sh
```

This will generate a report that includes:

- CPU Information
- Memory Details
- Disk Usage
- Network Configuration
- Kernel Version
- DMI Decoding

You can specify options to customize the report. Use the `-h` flag to see available options:

```bash
./server-hw-report.sh -h
```

### Example Output

Here is an example of what the output might look like:

```
